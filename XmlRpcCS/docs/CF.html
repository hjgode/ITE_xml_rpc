<h2>.NET Compact Framework Support
</h2>
Microsoft .NET Compact Framework is a subset of the .NET Assemblies and friends
geared towards running on PDA's and the like. Now, as near as I can tell, the
ONLY way to get a hold of these assemblies for your x86 development host is to
purchase Visual Studio .NET 2003.&nbsp; I did find a distributable package for
.NET CF on microsoft.com but it was only for the target platforms, none of which
I own. So while anyone with net access can code C# for free, it seems you have
to pony up for the .NET CF assemblies.&nbsp; Go figure.
<p>I did find, via Google, a document (NET_Compact_Framework.chm) that enumerated
for each class in .NET CF what was different from the full .NET.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Prerequisites to Build
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Have .NET development tool and the .NET Compact Framework</li>
  <li>have csc and friends in your PATH
  </li>
  <li>Have nmake<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>To Build</h2>
Check the LDIR path in makefile.nmake. In a command shell:
<pre>   nmake -f makefile.nmake
